    <h1>MamaCooking</h1>
    <p>MamaCooking is a recipe website that features thousands of homemade dishes, ranging from traditional Indonesian cuisine and international meals to trendy and easy-to-make snacks.

I was directly involved in the development of this website, specifically handling both the frontend and backend. On the frontend side, I built a responsive and user-friendly interface to ensure users can easily navigate and explore the content. On the backend, I managed the recipe data structure, search functionality, and implemented user account management and recipe-saving features efficiently.

    <h1>Sisfo Sarpras</h1>
    <p>The item borrowing website features an inventory management system designed to make it easier for users to borrow items.

I was responsible for both the frontend and backend development of this project. On the frontend, I built an interface that is user-friendly, responsive, and informative. On the backend, I handled the borrowing logic, item data management, user authentication, and the approval workflow to ensure the system runs smoothly and securely.

<h1>Game Horror Misteri Goa Ngawi</h1>
<p>Misteri Goa Ngawi is a 2D top-down horror game developed using Unity. Players explore a dark, silent cave, solve puzzles, and search for a way out while experiencing a tense and eerie atmosphere. I participated in designing the user interface (UI) to ensure the visuals were intuitive and supported the overall horror experience.</p>
